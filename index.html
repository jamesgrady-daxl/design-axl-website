      James’ design approach is a powerful combination of theory and execution. Informed by an empirically based methodology that he developed as part of his MFA thesis at Rhode Island School of Design, it encourages a deeper level of creative exploration, which he balances with an unparalleled understanding of brand and visual communication.

            During low tides, a powerful turbine water pump,
            built inside a cave at sea level, could be switched on from a control
            room and could fill the tanks at a rate of 6,000 US gallons a minute,
            recycling all the water in five hours.
